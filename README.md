# Funding_visualization

This is a minor personal project. It started as a university project, but I have since taken the data and tried to make it more visually appealing. This dashboard visualisez how DFF (Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond) have funded different universities, sciencetific fields and research topics from 2013 to 2022 The data have been scraped from DFF's public records of research grants and cleaned using pandas. It has been deployed with streamlit.
